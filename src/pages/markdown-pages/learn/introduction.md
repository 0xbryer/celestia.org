#### Summary
Welcome to learn modular, your go-to place to learn about modular blockchains and everything in between. We are building Learn Modular to cater to many different stages of learning, so hopefully there is content that will help you get a better grasp on the ideas behind modular blockchains.

Learn modular has three distinct categories; beginner, intermediate, and advanced. The beginner section focuses on the fundamentals. Specifically, bringing you up to speed on the basics of blockchains and the first principles behind modular blockchains. The intermediate section dives into more of the details behind modular blockchains and many of the new concepts that you will encounter when learning about Celestia. Finally, the advanced section explores the concepts learned in the intermediate section at a deeper level, and of course including a couple new concepts.

We hope you enjoy the material!
