            <p>Celestia keeps DA abundant and low-cost with DAS so that developers can create new kinds of expressive apps like onchain games and generative NFTs.</p>
            <p>Low fees also provide new options to monetize. For example, an app can take a percentage of transaction fees on its own rollup. With these new monetization options, teams can support user growth by subsidizing onboarding costs or eliminating specific user fees.</p>
