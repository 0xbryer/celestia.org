    <p>Bitcoin was the first blockchain and decentralized app. But Bitcoin’s limited functionality couldn’t support new applications.</p>
    <p>Then Ethereum built the first blockchain you could program for apps. However, developers faced scaling issues and limited customizability in Ethereum’s monolithic architecture.</p>
    <p>Now, Celestia introduces a new modular architecture that makes it easy for anyone to securely launch their own blockchain in just one click. With Celestia underneath, developers get scale and customizability to build new apps.</p>
