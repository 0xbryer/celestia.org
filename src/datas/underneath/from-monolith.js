    <p>Bitcoin was the first blockchain and decentralized app. But Bitcoin wasnâ€™t made for others to build apps on, so developers began building their own basic L1s.</p>
    <p>Then, Ethereum built the first blockchain you could program for apps. However, developers continued launching L1s with increasing development times and costs.</p>
    <p>Now, Celestia introduces a new modular architecture that makes it easy for anyone to securely launch their own blockchain. Without needing to recruit a committee, you can deploy your own chain with Celestia underneath in just one click.</p>
